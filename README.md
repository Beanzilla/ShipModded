# Ship Modded

### How do I get this to work?

So you get my plugin by multiple ways...

1. Using `git clone https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded.git to_your_plugins_directory/ShipModded` (Recommended so you can use `git pull` to "update")

2. Going to [Git Repo](https://github.com/Beanzilla/ShipModded) and selecting to download it as .zip or .tar.gz or some other compressed file (Not Recommended as it doesn't update easily)

From there locate your Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Linux: `~/.local/share/endless-sky/plugins/`

Windows: `C:\Users\yourusername\AppData\Roaming\endless-sky\plugins\` (Replace yourusername with your PC's username)

Unpack/Unzip/Unrar or move the directory/folder into the Endless Sky Plugins directory...

Then restart Endless Sky if it's already running...

Enjoy!

### What is it?

This is a plugin/mod designed to provide special items that "cheat" or "hack" in the game, it allows you to modify just about everything on your ship all within game instead of needing to modify your save file.

My Primary Goal was so game developers/testers can travel through the game with ease.

My Secondary Goal was to make it so it's "Semi-Balanced" this way someone can still enjoy the original game without needing/depending on my mod/plugin.

My Third Goal was to make it so it's compatible with other plugins/mods that may be installed along side Ship Modded.
